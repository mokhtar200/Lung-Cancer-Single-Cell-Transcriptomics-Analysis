# README: Lung Cancer Single-Cell Transcriptomics Analysis

## **Overview**

This project analyzes single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data from lung cancer samples to uncover insights into cellular heterogeneity, differential gene expression, and pathway activities within the tumor microenvironment. The pipeline is implemented in R using the Seurat package and focuses on real-world datasets to address critical research questions in lung cancer biology.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Cell Type Identification**: Clustering and annotation of cell types in lung cancer samples.
- **Differential Gene Expression (DEG) Analysis**: Identifies DEGs between tumor and normal tissue samples.
- **Pathway Enrichment Analysis**: Explores enriched pathways for specific cell types to understand biological processes.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Generates UMAP plots, heatmaps, and pathway barplots for intuitive data representation.

---

## **Project Goals**
1. Characterize the cellular composition of lung cancer tissues.
2. Identify key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their implications.
3. Explore tumor microenvironment interactions and pathway activities.

---

## **Requirements**
### **Software and Libraries**
- R (â‰¥4.0.0)
- [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/)
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- clusterProfiler
- Matrix

### **Data Source**
The project utilizes publicly available scRNA-Seq datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Replace `GSEXXXXXX` in the script with the actual dataset accession number.

---

## **Pipeline Overview**
1. **Data Acquisition**: Download scRNA-Seq data using the GEO accession ID.
2. **Preprocessing**: Perform quality control, normalization, and filtering.
3. **Clustering and Annotation**: Cluster cells and annotate cell types using known markers.
4. **Differential Expression Analysis**: Identify DEGs between tumor and normal tissues.
5. **Pathway Enrichment**: Analyze biological pathways enriched in specific clusters.
6. **Visualization**: Generate visualizations like UMAP plots, heatmaps, and pathway barplots.

## **Usage**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/lung_cancer_scrna_analysis.git
   cd lung_cancer_scrna_analysis
   ```
2. Install the required R libraries:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("Seurat", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "clusterProfiler"))
   ```
3. Update the script with the GEO dataset ID and the appropriate download path.
4. Run the R script to execute the analysis.

## **Output**
- **Plots**: UMAP plots, DEG heatmaps, and pathway barplots.
- **CSV Files**: DEG results saved as `DEGs_lung_cancer.csv`.
- **RDS File**: Processed Seurat object saved as `lung_cancer_scRNA.rds`.
